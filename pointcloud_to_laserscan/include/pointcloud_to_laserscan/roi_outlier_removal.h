* The ROI outlier removal removes all points outside the specified region of interest (ROI) and publishes the remaining points into a new pointcloud.
* The roi is defined as a z value range, angle range in the xy plane, and a max and min range in the xyy plane, for a chosen frame.
* The filter converts the roi borders to to the original pointcloud frame in order to not have to waist time on transforming points 
* that are not to be used later on.
* The points within the roi are transformed to and published in the same frame as the borders were given.
* The filter is relevant to the pointcloud to laserscan transformation since it creates a possibility to apply additional statistical filtering
* to a reduced pointcloud before creating the scan. The loclation of this filter within the pointcloud to laserscan package is however questionable.
